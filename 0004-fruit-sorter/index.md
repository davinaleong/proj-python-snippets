# **Task: Fruit Sorting Challenge**

You are given quantities of three fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. Write a Python program that:

1. Takes user input for the quantity of each fruit.
2. Uses **all six comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to compare the quantities.
3. Uses **increments (`+=`)** and **decrements (`-=`)** to update a "basket counter" for each fruit.
4. Prints out:
   - Which fruit has the highest quantity
   - If any fruits have the same or different amounts
   - Warnings if any fruit count is **too low** (≤ 5) or **plentiful** (≥ 10)
5. Calculates how many full baskets can be made with every **5 units** of fruit.
6. Outputs a summary of basket counts for each fruit.
