# 🍓 Fruit Picker Game

This is a fun little Python project that lets users select a range of fruits from a string of fruit emojis based on index positions. It's a great way to practice:

- User input
- String slicing
- Index validation
- Conditional logic

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A string of fruit emojis is stored in `fruit_line`.
2. The user is asked to input two numbers: a **start index** and an **end index**.
3. If the start index is greater than the end index, the program swaps them automatically.
4. A slice of the fruit string is taken between the two indices.
5. The selected fruits are displayed!
